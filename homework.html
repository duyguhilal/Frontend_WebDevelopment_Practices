            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p><i> I'm Duygu! I am a Management Information Systems student at Izmir Bakırçay University. I am interested in the impact of information systems in other fields. The idea that technology is limitless excites me. For this purpose, I continue my education by participating in training programs and completing internships.</i></p>

            <h2>My hobbies</h2>
            <p>As a management information systems student, I aim to make a successful career in the business world in the future by using the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my courses. In my spare time from the intense pace of my classes, I turn to hobbies that will relax and entertain me.

                One of my biggest hobbies is tennis. I love playing this sport both outdoors and on indoor courts. I exercise both my body and mind while playing tennis. In this way, I relieve my stress and renew myself.
                
                Another hobby of mine is swimming. Swimming is a very healthy sport that exercises the whole body. Especially in the summer months, I love going to the pool or the sea to cool off and have a pleasant time.
                
                Finally, taekwondo is a sport that I am interested in. By doing this sport, I learn to defend myself and at the same time experience working in a disciplined manner.
                
                Apart from tennis, swimming and taekwondo, I also have hobbies such as reading books, watching movies and listening to music. Thanks to these hobbies, I try to improve myself and enrich myself culturally.
                
                I both have fun and improve myself while doing my hobbies. In this way, I relieve the stress of my classes and live a happier life.</p>
